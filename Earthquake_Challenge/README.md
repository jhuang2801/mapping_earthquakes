# mapping_earthquakes

In this activity, JavaScript, Leaflet.js and geoJSON data were used to map out global tectonic map. There is three layers of map created using d3.json() - street view, satellite view, and dark view. Users can choose to view the map using any of the layers. Users can pick any of the three map views according to preference. 

For the earthquake data layer, users, again, have three choices when viewing the distribution of earthquake occurrences around the globe. First layer, "Earthquakes", displays the location of the earthquakes on the map, with the degree of magnitude determinining the size and the color of the label. Second layer, "tectonic plates", shows the boundaries of earth's principal tectonic plates, which should coincide with the occurrences of the earthquakes. Third layer, "Major Earthquakes", is distinguishing the  earthquake with high degrees of magnitudes vs lesser earthquakes: magnitude greater than 6 (in red), between 5 and 6 (in orange), and less than 5 (in green). For these earthquake data, users can pick any or all 3 to view the data per need (in conjunction with the different map layer).
